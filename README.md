# factorio-data

This repo has been made publicly available to help mod authors. :smiley::+1:

It's purpose is to allow the public to track changes to the Factorio **LUA prototype definitions**.

See https://github.com/wube/factorio-data/releases for past versions.
Compare versions using git on the command line, or by using magic github comparison urls, 
eg: https://github.com/wube/factorio-data/compare/0.14.23...0.15.40

## Some Potential Use Cases of Data

* Online references, cheat sheets, and calculators.
* It can be used to automate mod updates when new versions are released.
* You may link directly to specific library code and entity definitions when discussing such matters on the forums, GitHub issues for mods, Discord etc.
* Browse diffs between the versions, seeing the implementation of prototype changes we mention in the changelog.
